# PlateGate

> Fully featured system to manage closed parking spaces

## Todo
- Rewrite tests
- split files to independent packages

## How to build
### Although this is probably too old to run perfectly (or run at all)
- clone using `git clone`
- cd into the directory `cd PlateGate`
- create a venv using `python -m venv .venv`
- activate the venv (on bash use `source .venv/bin/activate`)
- then install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
